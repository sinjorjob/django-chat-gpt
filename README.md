## 2 Image Generation from Text

Second, input an image or a brief description of the image to be generated on the screen, and Chat-GPT will generate a richly expressive description based on that description.

Based on the description, Chat-GPT generates an image from the text using Stable Diffusion (image generation model) and displays it on the screen (see the figure below).
